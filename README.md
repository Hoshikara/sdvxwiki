# SDVX WIKI
This is a wiki page for the game Sound Voltex made mainly with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

Every page on the wiki is a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file. Tagged with .mdx, each page is essentially just a notepad with markdown features. For information on how to use markdown see [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

This project is running on Next.js with Tailwind CSS.

## Development

If you don't already have an opinion on how to get the project setup and hosted locally, here is one way to do it:

1) Clone the project with `git`.
2) Download Node.js using the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download), with settings `v22.14.0 (LTS)`, your operating system, `nvm`, `pnpm`.
3) Run `pnpm install` in the project folder to install dependencies.
4) Run `pnpm run build` to build the project.
5) Run `pnpm run start` to host the project locally; the address to view the site will be listed next to `- Local:`.
6) Redo steps 4 and 5 after each change.
