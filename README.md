# SDVX WIKI
This is a wiki page for the game Sound Voltex made mainly with [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

Every page on the wiki is a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file. Tagged with .mdx, each page is essentially just a notepad with markdown features. For information on how to use markdown see [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

This project is running on Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
