# Getting Started

This guide assumes you already know what Sound Voltex is or are interested in playing it. If you have no clue what it is about (how did you get here), it is recommended checking out [Leviern's GDQ showcase of SDVX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NePZzIFKW_s).

To start, choose how you want to play. If you are new and have no clue, it is recommended heading to an arcade. More information about how to find an arcade with an SDVX cab can be found [here](/gettingstarted/arcade).

If you don't have access to an arcade, your next best option is [Konasute (コナステ)](/konasute) which requires a monthly fee. Otherwise, there is [USC/KSM](/setup/USCKSM) which are free.
