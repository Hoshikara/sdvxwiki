# Welcome to the Sound Voltex wiki/guide. 
This website was made to try and help people learn more about SDVX. 

A lot of information about this game is scattered about on the internet, usually in a different language or hidden away in years old threads, I decided to make this to try and help players get into the game and learn more/refresh on what Sound Voltex is, how to play, and other questions

Whether you are new or a veteren, the goal is for this website to contain all the information about this game in one spot. It can act as a guide for new players or refresher on certain stuff.

On the left you can see all the topics that are on this website. There is also a search bar if you need to find something specific. 

If you are interesting in contributing or helping, you can head to the github and learn more about how to help.

If you are a complete beginner and want to learn more, I would recommend starting at the [Getting Started](/gettingstarted) folder
