# Welcome to the Sound Voltex wiki/guide.

This website was made to try and help people learn more about Sound Voltex (officially abbreviated as SDVX).

A lot of information about this game is scattered about on the internet, usually in a different language or hidden away in years-old threads, I decided to make this to try and help players get into the game and learn more/refresh on what Sound Voltex is, how to play, and other questions.

Whether you are new or a veteran, the goal is for this website to contain all the information about this game in one spot. It can act as a guide for new players or a refresher on various topics.

On the left you can see all the topics that are on this website. There is also a search bar if you need to find something specific.

If you are a complete beginner, I would recommend starting [here](/gettingstarted).

If you are interested in contributing, you can head to the [GitHub](https://github.com/zzunja/sdvxwiki) to learn more.
