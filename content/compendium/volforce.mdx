# Volforce
Volforce is the main way seen to measure "skill". Of course it's not 100%, but in theory higher volforce = better you are. 

Your volforce is a combination of your best 50 plays. After every play, the game calulates the volforce of that play with this equation.

<Callout>
This equation is techincally wrong. Voltex doesn't include the .001, it takes it as a whole number and just rounds down to a whole number. It then takes that number, adds it to the best 50, then divides that sum by 1000. I add the .001 to simplify this whole process. It still gives the same answer, just different ways to get to that.

Grade Coefficient/Factor

| S | AAA+ | AAA | AA+ | AA | A+ | A | B | C | D |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1.05|1.02|1.00|0.97|0.94|0.91|0.88|0.85|0.82|0.80|

Clear Coefficent/Factor

|PUC|UC|Excessive Rate Clear|Effective rate clear|Crash|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|1.10|1.05|1.02|1.00|0.50|
</center>

For example, if I got a score of 9,909,432 (S) on a level 18 with a Excessive Rate clear, this is how I would calulate my volforce.
<br/>
<center>
``(18*(9,909,432 / 10,000,000)*(1.05)*(1.02)*20)*.001``
</center>
This gives me .38206806. Since voltex doesn't count anything past the 3rd digit, we can just remove that part and we get our answer **.382**.

The important things to note is that the only things taken into consideration is Level of the chart, Score, Clear type, and Grade.

<br/>
After it calulates this number, it then compares it to your best 50. If this
number is higher than the lowest volforce play in your best 50, you will gain
the difference of that volforce. For example, lets look at our last example.
Lets say I just set that score. Voltex will look at the lowest VF score in my
best 50. If that was .370, it will replace that volforce with this one and I
will gain .382-.370=**0.012 volforce**. This will be shown on screen next to
your volforce if this happens.

You can tell what is in your best 50 if it has what is circled in red.

The symbol next to the best 50 will be different depending on what your current VF is.

There is also a best 50 folder, although note that this is not sorted by volforce but rather whatever sort you have selected.

## Skill Ranks
There are different skill ranks for different milestone in volforce. Here are all of them

![volforceranks](/copendium/volforce/volforceranks.png)

In general, Scarlet (15.000 VF) is when your VF rank starts to be """""important""""". Generally, this is the point where you start to really get into the game.

I say important with heavy quotes as volforce is never really important and constantly chasing it is usually a bad idea. These are all arbitary numbers that are just made up.

At Imperial (20.00 VF), instead of ranking up every 1.000 VF, it changes to
every 4.000 VF. This is currently the cap on VF rank. There is nobody that is
past this point because there isn't enough charts to fill up your best 50 enough
to reach past 24.000 VF.

The two people that are currently max VF are [Mini](https://www.youtube.com/@minisdvx7740) and [Jakads](https://www.youtube.com/@Jakads_realkk). They have PUC every 20 to come out.
