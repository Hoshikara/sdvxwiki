<Callout>
Unlocks in Konasute are different and most of what is said here doesn't apply. The only unlock system in Konasute is blaster gate.

If you plan to go on a big unlocking session, it is highly recommended to get the Blaster Pass as it makes unlock stuff much faster and will save a lot of money.

There are multiple different ways to unlock songs. Unforently, it can sometimes
be hard to find a specific way to unlock a specific song. You can often times
find how to unlock a song by googling it and finding the remywiki. At the bottom
it will say how to unlock it.

This page will go over what all the unlocks are, what they all mean, and how to use them.

For a good guide on how to use all unlocks, you can check this sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VBYWSUaKqHUOyfCtvkHFYBSnEPwxhTh8-m4UlU8zUL0/edit?gid=594247546#gid=594247546).

## Blaster Gate
Blaster gate songs are locked away in the blaster gate folder. Songs that are
locked by blaster gate can be seen on the main song selected with a lock system.
To open and unlock a song from this folder, you have to fill up the blaster
gauge. This is shown at the end of a song here.

After this bar hits 100%, you can go into the blaster gate folder and play the
song you would like to unlock. Unless you have the blaster pass, you have to
clear the chart to unlock it. Clearing the higher difficulty will also unlock
the lower difficulties.

No matter if you pass or fail, your blaster gauge will go back to 0.

If you fail to clear the song 15 times, it will automatically unlock no matter if you pass or fail.

### Omega dimension
Omega dimension works the exact same as blaster gate, except that it is in a different folder. 

## Hexadiver
Hexadivers is one of the exceed gear unlock system. After your blaster gauge is
100% you are able to access this folder. Each Hexadiver is a seperate folder
contains 7 charts with a 20 at the end. 

When first going into a hexadiver, there will only be 3 songs available to unlock. New songs will show up after other songs are unlocked. 

Each song has 10000 HP. You unlock difficulties of the chart after hitting the
HP thresholds of 1000 NOV, 2500 ADV, 5000 EXH, and 10000 MXM. Playing on higher
difficulties let you do more damage. Also, you can only unlock up to the
difficulty you are playing. For example, if you play the EXH, you can't do more
dmg or go past the EXH threshold of 5000 meaning you can't unlock the MXM.

After selecting a chart, you will choose how difficult you want your gauge. The
higher the difficulty, the more dmg you do, but the harder it is. In general,
HR4 is around Excessive and HR5 is even harder than that.

Hexadivers before Akasha have certain changes only applied to them. Specifically Hexadivers 1-9 from 幻想御伽篇 to 彩虹の銀幕篇. These changes are
- HEXA BLASTER: You are able to play Hexa diver multiple times on a single credit.
- HEXA CONTINUE: If you fail out of a song, your blaster energy is not consumed.
- HEXA OVERDRIVE: Each time a Hexa diver song cleared, a dmg multiplier is added. This is reset every day
