# Gamemodes
There are a couple different gamemodes other than just normal play. In this section, we will go over each one and what they are and what the difference between them all are.

<Callout>If you are playing Konasute コナステ, the only two gamemodes available are normal and skill analyzer. Most of what is being said here does not apply to you.</Callout>
## Normal
Normal, or a normal play is the default play for Sound Voltex. Usually this is
the cheapest option. There exist 2 types of normal play, light and standard
play. Light can be cheaper, but has a lot of downsides. 
- Light start doesn't have S-Crits, or ARS along with some other options
- There is a max of 3 songs per credit, ex-track bar does not go up
- If you fail a song, your credit will end
- There are level restrictions depending on what dan you are. The lower dan, the higher the level restrictions. Only on the last song will you be able to play any chart regardless of the level

If you are in the US, most likely light and standard are the same amount of credits. There is no point in ever choosing light in that case.

After selecting a song, you will go into matching. Here you can wait for someone to join you or just skip by pressing both FX buttons.

## Friend
Friend is how you can play with another person at your arcade. Friend is only
local meaning that both you and your friend has to be at the same arcade on two
machines. This gamemode works similarly to Normal play. 

Once in, you both will see song select and can select a song. You will be able to 
see everything you both have unlocked, so for example if Person A doesn't have 666 
but Person B does, Person A will be able to see and select 666. Once someone
selects something, it will show up on the other screen for them to choose what
difficulty they want to play at. After selecting, you both will go into matching
together. 

You can play a max of 3 credits together regardless of whether you both get a ex-track or not. If you get a ex-track, it will act as if you are just doing a normal credit.

## Battles
Battles is how you can play with other people from anywhere. There are 3
different types of battles, Arena battle, Single battle, and Megamix battle. For
all of these there is a choice of Online or Local. Local means only people in
your arcade while online means anyone from anywhere can match. When choosing
online, you will be forced to put in a 6 digit code, and everyone who wants to
join the room also has to put in this 6 digit code.

### Arena battle
Match with up to 4 people. Each person selects the chart they want to play. After everyone selects, it then chooses a random chart. 

## Premium Time
Premium time is usually the more expensive option. This comes with some perks with the main one being that you can play all you want for 10 minutes. The main changes are
- 10 minute timer instead of a set amount of tracks
- All the features of standard start
- Can exit a chart at any time by pressing both fx and start
- Can instantly retry a chart by holding both fx and start
- Can set challenge where you will automatically crash out if you can no longer achieve the challenge (For example, if I set it to PUC challenge and then got a near, It would crash me out)
- No blaster gate
- Because of no blaster gate, can't unlock any songs that make use of the blaster gauge
- Pressing all BT buttons on song select can end your credit early

Premium time is nice for when you are grinding for a score or clear on a chart and want to be able to play and repeat the chart multiple times.
