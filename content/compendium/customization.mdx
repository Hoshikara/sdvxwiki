# Customizations
<Callout>
Unless said otherwise, most stuff in here is arcade exclusive.
</Callout>
There exist a lot of ways to customize your game. You can change the Crew, BGM,
Background, Touchscreen Background, NEMSYS controller, and stickers. Most of
these are obtained through gacha. You can sometimes get certain crews through
events and the arena shop though. To customize everything besides crew, you can

## Basic and Premium Course
<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
Basic and Premium courses **charge you at the beginning of the month for that month no matter when you buy it**. For example, if you buy the Basic course on 1/31, you will lose access and have to pay again on 2/1.

There is no point in buying this if you don't go to the arcade and only play konasute. You also don't need it to change your navigator.

### Valkiyrie Rolling
Not to be confused with the online valkiyrie rolling, this is an in-game rolling
system that is only availble outside the US. On these you can get the same item

rolling to get them.
