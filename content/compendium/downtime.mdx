# Maintenace/Downtime
Schedule maintenace happens everyday. During this downtime, you will not be able to access the E-Amusement website. Meaning, you won't be able to open Konasute コナステ during these times.

There are two types of maintenace.

## Regular Maintenace
**Every day, from 5 AM to 7 AM JST**

Here is the downtime translated to mainly America timezones. For daylight savings, add an hour.

  |MST|1 PM - 3 PM|
  |PST|12 PM - 2 PM|

If you are in Japan or in the Asian region, exclusing Saturday and Sunday, you
will not be able to play on the cabinets at these times. American cabs on the US
region are excluded from this, meaning you can still play while maintenace is
happening.

## Extended Maintenace
**Third tuesday of the month, from 2 AM to 7 AM JST**

This maintenace applies to all regions for the Arcade and Konasute. Meaning, you
won't be able to play during these times even at the arcade.

The only exception to this maintenace is if it falls on a national holiday in
Japan, which it gets moved to the next day. 

## Notes
If you are playing Konasute and want to play during maintenace hours, you can
open the game/launcher before the maintenace happens and play. You will not be
kicked out once maintenace happens. Your scores will submit like normal. If you
close the game or your game crashes, you will not be able to re-launch the game.

It is recommened to follow the [twitter bot](https://x.com/eamuse_schedule) that
will tweet out warnings and times for extended maintenace and normal maintenace.
It also tweets when the servers come back online.
