# Song Select and Options

## Song Select

When starting the game, you will be brought to song select. Here you select the chart you want to play. You cna move through the songs or folders with VOL-R knob (Right). Change the difficulty with the VOL-L knob. Pressing Start will select what you are hovering. 

Pressing FX-L (left) will close the current folder that is open. Pressing FX-R (right) will open the sorting menu. Here is a general translation of what everything means.

<img src='/startingout/Sort.png' width="600"/>

When hovering a song, you can press 0 to favorite it. This will add it to a seperate folder. You can have up to 50 songs favorited.

Pressing 8 while on this screen will open the Rival leaderboard and Location/National best leaderboard. 

Pressing 3 will choose a random chart in the folder selected.

Holding FX-L/R and scrolling will scroll faster. 

If in premium time, Pressing all the BT buttons will give you the option to leave premium time.

## Options
While on song select, pressing FX-L and FX-R will bring up the options menu. On valkiery cabs you can also access it on the touch screen. This guide will go over all the options, what they do, and recommended settings.

### Lane Speed
![lanespeed](/startingout/LaneSpeed.png)

This is the first setting that appears when opening. Using the right knob you can adjust it from 1 to 10. When starting out, you will most likely hover around 2-4. As your reading skill gets better you will generally start to increase this to make things eaiser to read. In general, The higher the lane speed = the less notes on screen = the eaiser it is to read. 
Pressing Numpad 6 will lock your lane speed so that it will default set it to whatever it is set to. 

Lane speed is very much preference. Some people can read 9+ lane speed while others stay at 6-8. How fast you can read is really dependent on a lot of different things. 

A lot of people confuse lane speed with how fast the chart is. Increasing your lane speed doesn't increase the speed of the chart, just changes how long notes are on screen. Here is an example of how lane speed affects charts.

Even though they look different, They are playing the exact same chart. It isn't "faster" or "slower". Just looks different

### Offset
![offset](/startingout/Offset.png)

There are 2 offsets. Draw and Judge. Draw is visual offset and Judge is audio. Draw moves the judgement line either up (+) or down (-). It doesn't do this visually, the judgement line will still be in the same spot but it has moved. Judge just adds offset to the music. 
If you are on a Valkyrie Cabinet, pressing the offset number on the touchscreen will change it to ms. 

If you are hitting late, moving to the negative may help. If you are hitting early, moving to the positive may help. 

Your offset will sometimes change day-to-day setup-to-setup. Some days you might just be reading slower so you move your draw negative. Some machines may have more audio lag so you change your judge. 

An important thing to note is that a lot of times it isn't your offset but rather your lane speed/reading ability. If you notice you are hitting a lot of lates or earlies, maybe its time to adjust your lane speed.

If you are having trouble finding your offset [here is JiminP guide.](https://r-g.kr/article/sync)

### Early Late adjustment
![earlylate](/startingout/Earlylate.png)

The next 3 are adjustments to the early late that show up when you press something off timing. 

![earlyexample](/startingout/Earlyexample.png)
The first one adjust when the early/late shows up. (Pictured above) Critical will make it so every time you hit a crit or below it will show up. Near will make it so only nears and below it will show up. Off means it never shows up

![msexample](/startingout/msexmaple.png)
The second one adjust when the ms show up. (Pictured above) All will show it for everything, even S-Crit. Note that if you hit a S-Crit, it will be grey. Critical will make it so every time you hit a crit or below it will show up. Near will make it so only nears amd below it will show up. Off means it never shows up.

The final option adjust where they show up. 

In general, it is a good idea to have one of them only show up for nears and the other show up for all or just crits. That way you know if you hit a near.

### S-Critical
![SCrit](/startingout/SCrit.png)

This adds an extra judgement that is stricter then Crit. This does not affect normal scoring. 

Note that if you are using light start this will not be accessible. This does not matter for Konasute. In general, there is not a reason to have this off if you have the option.

### Lane preview
![preview](/startingout/Preview.png)

Here you can preview your changes you just made. It will play a simple chart with a simple song where you can see your lane speed, offsets, and early/late adjustments. I'd recommend using this to figure out what you like.

### System Voice
![systemvoice](/startingout/SystemVoice.png)

You can choose to disable or enable the voice from your navigator that plays around the menus. For example the voice that plays when you complete a chart.

### Show SDVX Konasute/Arcade scores
![showscores](/startingout/ShowScores.png)

If you play on Konasute, you can choose to see your Konasute (or arcade if you are playing Konasute) scores. Note that Volforce is seperate and that you don't actually have that score unless you got it on that system. For example, if you are rivaled with someone on arcade, they will only see your arcade scores.

You can tell which scores are from Konasute or Arcade by if this light in the top is lit.

![showkonasutescore](/startingout/ShowKonasuteScores.png)
Here it shows that this score was from arcade because the Arcade is lit up.

### Valkyrie Effect
![valkyrieeffect](/startingout/ValkyrieEffect.png)

This changes how the lasers look. Enabling it adds a bit more effect to lasers. Some people like this off. If you would like to see the difference, [Here is a Side-by-Side by Neardayo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnpcD08o4t8)

### Early Late Color
![earlylateflip](/startingout/Earlylateflip.png)

This flips the early late colors. Normally, Late are blue and Early is pink/red. This flips them. 

### Laser Colors
![lasercolors](/startingout/lasercolors.png)

These change the laser colors. The first one is the left laser and the second one is the right laser. Most people don't change these. Although notably Mini has his left laser (Normally blue) as green.

### Display Brightness
![displaybrightness](/startingout/displaybrightness.png)

This is how bright the background is. If you want a good example, look at the Lane Speed video above. Mini plays on a brighter background compared to JiminP and DDX.

### Normal Scoring and Ex Scoring
![normalscoreexscore](/startingout/normalscoreexscore.png)

This switches between Normal Scoring and EX Scoring. Normal Scoring is the score that is graded and used for Volforce. It has a max of 10,000,000 on every chart and is based on Crit, Nears, and errors. EX Scoring is based off S-Crits, Crits, Nears, and Errors. It is calulated differently with every S-Crit worth 5 points, Crit worth 4, Near worth 2, Error worth 0. Every chart has a different max score.  

Even if you use EX-score, your normal score is still calulated and same vice versa (as long as you have s-crits enabled). You can see your EX-Score right under your score on any chart.

If you are just starting out, there is generally no reason to use Ex Scoring. 

### Random and Mirror
![randommirror](/startingout/RandomMirror.png)

This changes how the chart is.
- Mirror flips the chart. For example a chart that is normally a 1-2-3-4 staircase is now a 4-3-2-1 staircase.
- Random randomizes the lanes the notes come down. For example, a 1-2-3-4 staircase now can become 3-2-4-1.
- S-Random completely randomizes the notes as well, so any note can be anything

![randommirrorexample](/startingout/RandomMirrorExamples.png)

In general, Mirror is the only useable option. Random and S-Ran often makes charts have illegal patterns.

### Effective/Excessive Clear
![ClearType](/startingout/ClearType.png)

This is the clear type options.

- Effective Rate: Start at 0% and work up to above 70% gauge to clear
- Excessive Rate: Start at 100% and survive the whole chart without it dropping to 0 to clear. Errors take more off the gauge and harder to build up compared to Effective.
- Excessive + ARS: Starts Excessive Rate and if you fail out of Excessive, then go to Effective. Your Effective Gauge is still calulated as you play so you wont start at 0% if you die in Excessive.

Clear type will affect your Volforce. Excessive is harder so it is worth more volforce. 

Excessive + ARS is not availble on light start. This does not matter if you play konasute. In general, you should always play with Excessive + ARS if you have the option. 

### Volume
![audiolevels](/startingout/audiolevels.png)

This is Volume. If you are playing on Konasute, this will be general game volume (like in the screenshot). If you are at an arcade, this will be headset volume. If you don't have an headset plugged in at the arcade this will do nothing. 

### Challenge Options
![challenge](/startingout/challenge.png)

These are the challenge options. Basically, during a run if you fall below the point to get the grade that you have selected you will automatically fail out. For example if I selected UC and I missed a note, it would auto fail me out. 

## Additional things to note

Most of these settings are completely preference. There are general recommended settings but nothing is concrete. Try out things and see if you like them. 

Valkyrie Cabinets have more settings then Konasute and Nemsys cabs. While Konasute has most of them, there are some Valkyrie exclusive features.
