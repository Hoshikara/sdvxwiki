## Intro
Here, you will find common terms and vocabulary used in conversations about SDVX.

This will mainly go over SDVX terms, there are other terms that exist. For more general terms, you can look at [this video](https://youtu.be/CVm5y4TQjXI)


## Clears
#### S-PUC/Max/Max-0
This is when you get only S-Crit and above, meaning no crits, nears, or errors. 

#### PUC/Perfect Ultimate Chain/Perfect
This is when you get only crits and above, meaning no nears or errors. 

It is also called a Perfect Ultimate Chain in-game

#### UC/Ultimate Chain/Full Combo/FC
This is when you get no errors in a chart. You keep your combo throughout the chart.

It is also called an Ultimate Chain in-game

#### Hard clear/Excessive Clear
This is clearing with the gauge that starts at 100% and goes to 0%. This gauge is considered harder than a normal clear, hence **Hard** clear.

#### Clear/Effective Clear
This is a clear with the gauge that starts at 0% and you have to be over 70% gauge.

#### Crash/Fail
This is when you fail a chart either by not getting the 70% mark, hitting 0% on Excessive gauge, or quitting out.

## Scoring
#### S
This is a score above 9,900,000. This is commonly what people aim for when going for accuracy. See more about scores and grades [here](/startingout/playingscoring)

#### Ex-score
This is an alternative form of scoring that factors in S-Crits which is a tighter timing window. 

#### Max-`x`
`x` in this refers to any number.

This refers to how far away you were from a max-0. For example, if you were max-2, that means you were 2 crits away from a max-0 or a S-PUC.

Notably, if you score good enough instead of showing a percentage for your max score, it will show a MAX-`x`.
