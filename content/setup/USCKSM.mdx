# USC and KSM
There are two simulators you can use for Sound Voltex. While simulators are not as accurute, they can be used to play custom charts and also converts of offical charts. 

You can either play Untitled Sound Voltex Clone (USC) or K-Shoot Mania (KSM). KSM is much older and it's age shows. USC is more new and has a lot of features but considered to have a worse engine (mainly noticable with lasers). I'd recommned using USC to get started as it is easier to use and comes with a lot more features.

## USC Set-Up
<Callout>
 This will only go through setting up USC. There is a lot of stuff you can do with it and this guide won't go through all the stuff that is in it.
</Callout>
To start, head to [the USC Github](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/releases/) and download the latest version.

Extract this file to a folder on your computer and run usc-game.exe one time. This will launch the game and create all the files we need. You can now close the game.

### Skins
While the default skin is fine, you will most likely want other skins. Head to [this website](https://oniichan.wtf/help/skins.html) and choose a skin to your liking. Most likely you will want to either use
- Nightfall. Has S-Crits and shows a lot of information. If you don't know what to get, get this one.
- LiqidWave. Makes your game look as similar to Sound Voltex Vivid Wave as possible. If you like Vivid Wave or just the Sound Voltex look get this one.
- Heavenly Express. Basically LiquidWave, but for Sound Voltex Heavenly Haven. 

The rest of the skins are mostly out-of-date or not used. 

After you download the one you want, put the folder into the skins folder. For example, /USC/skins is where I would put my skins. Make sure they are extracted.

### Options
Press the Settings button on the main screen to take you to the settings. While most of the stuff I won't go over, some important things to change are 
- Input. Set up your controls here. If you are using a controller, set it to gamepad mode (one without a mouse) and use a controller for both input modes. Also recommended to calibrate your laser sensitivity. 
- Game. Set Speed mod type to MMod. This is how it is SDVX. You can set your speed here if you want, or change it in the game.
- Skin. Select your skin. Depending on the skin it might have some additional settings for you to configure. 


## K-Shoot Mania Set-Up
Head to the [K-Shoot Mania website](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/) to download KSM. Click on download and download the full version.

Unzip it to a folder you like and open kshootmania.exe. Head to settings and select input settings. Change it to what you would like. If you are using a Faucetwo, I'd recommend following [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xumGVMSXAdeslJz_e8pyn7eALaT33WgEgSbiKrib9s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.prjnuk1isuqy) guide on how to set up your inputs. Otherwise, you can put charts in the songs folder and start playing. 

KSM can link to your twitter account to get leaderboard, but it isn't needed and is mostly dead. It will ask you this every time you go to your songs. 

To change Hi-Speed, hold BT-D and press the up and down arrows if you are on song select. In the game just press the arrows. If you are stuck on a multiplier, press the left or right arrow keys to select the number. The number is out of 1000, but 1000 is the same as 10.00 lane speed. (900 is 9.0, 850 is 8.5, etc.)

### Skins
There are also KSM skins, but they are generally harder to find. A lot of them are really old and some are in Japanese only. Some download links are also lost to time. You can maybe find some [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/wiki/skins/). 

To install a skin, backup your **imgs** and **se** folders. This is your default skin. I would recommend putting this in a folder if something happens. Alternatively you can also just redownload KSM to get it back. After this, extract the skin into the root of your folder and replace anything that needs to be replaced. This will install the skin for you. 


## Charts
To find custom made charts, you can head to [ksm.dev](https://ksm.dev/) and find most custom charts made by people. While they definitly vary in quality, and a lot of them are higher level charts, it can be a good way of finding charts for songs you like.

You can also play converts. Older charts can be found [here](https://oniichan.wtf/help/songs.html) and for recent charts, you can find them in ][this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8gj7-waR4o4o7gU_NZtR3VmsD8UY4ho).

After downloading a chart, place the folder in the songs folder. For example, /USC/songs is where I would put my songs. Make sure they are extracted and in their folder.

You can also organize charts in folders. For example if you want all your downloaded charts in one folder, you can create a folder and place it in there. You can then sort by this folder in both USC and KSM. 
USC doesn't support multi folder organization (i.e /songs/NauticaDownloads/2024. USC wouldn't recognize 2024 but still see all the songs in that folder.) but KSM does.
