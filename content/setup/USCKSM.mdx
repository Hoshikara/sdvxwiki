# USC and KSM

There are two simulators you can use for Sound Voltex. While simulators are not as gameplay-accurate, they can be used to play custom charts and converts of official charts.

You can either play Unnamed Sound Voltex Clone (USC) or K-Shoot Mania (KSM). 

## USC
This is the most up-to-date SDVX Clone. It is open source and still occasionally
gets updates. The main downside is that the engine, specifically the lasers, are known to feel incorrect. 

#### Pros
- Runs better
- Easier to set up
- More settings
- Still gets updates (occasionally)

#### Cons
- Lasers are worse
- Engine feels worse

## K-Shoot Mania
K-Shoot Mania is the old simulator that is loved by many players. While no
longer getting updates, it is still commonly used by many people for its
better engine. It also is easier to use for OS difficulty and Insane KSM. There
are also leaderboards although not very active.

#### Pros
- Better engine
- Lasers feel better
- Works natively with Insane KSM
- Leaderboards

#### Cons
- Old and shows its age
- Tends to run worse
- Can be a bit tedious to setup


## USC Setup
<Callout>
  This will only go through setting up USC. There is a lot of stuff you can do
  with it and this guide won't go through all the stuff that is in it.
</Callout>
To start, head to [the USC GitHub](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/releases/)
and download the latest version.

Extract the contents to a folder on your computer and run `usc-game.exe`. This will launch the game and create all the files we need. You can now close the game.

### Skins

While the default skin is fine, you will most likely want other skins. Head to
[this website](https://oniichan.wtf/help/skins.html) and choose a skin to your
liking. 

- **Nightfall:** Has S-Crits, Hit graph, offset details, and other information. Up-to-date.
- **LiqidWave:** Makes your game look as similar to Sound Voltex Vivid Wave as possible. 
- **Heavenly Express:** Basically LiquidWave, but for Sound Voltex Heavenly Haven.

The rest of the skins are mostly out-of-date or not used.

After you download the one you want, extract the folder into the skins folder. For example, `/USC/skins` is where I would put my skins.

### Options

Press the Settings button on the main screen to take you to the settings. While most of the stuff I won't go over, some important things to change are

- Input. Set up your controls here. If you are using a controller, set it to gamepad mode (one without a mouse) and use a controller for both input modes. It is also recommended to calibrate your laser sensitivity.
- Game. Set Speed mod type to MMod. This is how it is SDVX. You can set your speed here if you want, or change it in the game.
- Skin. Select your skin. Depending on the skin it might have some additional settings for you to configure.



## K-Shoot Mania Setup

Head to the [K-Shoot Mania website](https://www.kshootmania.com/en/) to download KSM. Click on download and download the full version.

Unzip it to a folder you like and open `kshootmania.exe`. Head to settings and select input settings. Change it to what you would like. If you are using a FauceTwo, it is recommend following [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_xumGVMSXAdeslJz_e8pyn7eALaT33WgEgSbiKrib9s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.prjnuk1isuqy) guide on how to set up your inputs. Otherwise, you can put charts in the songs folder and start playing.

KSM can link to your Twitter account to access leaderboard, but it isn't needed and is mostly dead. It will ask you this every time you go to your songs.

To change Hi-Speed, hold BT-D and press the up and down arrows if you are on song select. In the game just press the arrows. If you are stuck on a multiplier, press the left or right arrow keys to select the number. The number is out of 1000, but 1000 is the same as 10.00 lane speed. (900 is 9.0, 850 is 8.5, etc.)

### Skins

There are also KSM skins, but they are generally harder to find. A lot of them are really old and some are in Japanese only. Some download links are also lost to time. You can maybe find some [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kshootmania/wiki/skins/).

To install a skin, backup your **imgs** and **se** folders. This is your default skin. It is recommend backing this up if something happens. Alternatively you can also just redownload KSM to get it back. After this, extract the skin into the root of your folder and replace anything that needs to be replaced. This will install the skin for you.

## Charts

To find custom made charts, you can head to [ksm.dev](https://ksm.dev/). While they can definitely vary in quality, and a lot of them are higher level charts, it can be a good way of finding charts for songs you like.

You can also play converts. Older charts can be found [here](https://oniichan.wtf/help/songs.html) and for recent charts, you can find them in [this Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8gj7-waR4o4o7gU_NZtR3VmsD8UY4ho).

After downloading a chart, extract and place the folder in the songs folder. For example, `/USC/songs` is where I would put my songs. Do not remove the song folder from the folder that it comes in as songs are organized by the game version that they belong to.

You can also organize charts in folders. For example if you want all your downloaded charts in one folder, you can create a folder and place it in there. You can then sort by this folder in both USC and KSM.
USC doesn't support multi folder organization (i.e `/songs/NauticaDownloads/2024`) USC wouldn't recognize 2024, but still see all the songs in that folder. KSM would recognize 2024 and show it in game.
