# What input should I use?

Voltex can be played with many different input devices. In this guide we will go through all the different types of controller options there are and what is best.

Controllers are expensive! If you are just starting out, I'd recommend trying the game either at a arcade or with your keyboard before you go all in with a controller. Make sure you like the game first!

  This guide does not list all the controllers/ways to play. There are many different controllers out there. This just goes through some of the more common ones.

## Arcade-Size Controllers
These are the best controllers and considered "necessary" to start really playing the game. While you can play on keyboard or other devices, it's considered a very different game.

There are a couple options when it comes to controllers. The main choices are either a Faucetwo or Yuancon. Gameplay wise, these controllers are essentially the same. It seems more people use a Faucetwo though so I will go over that first.

### Faucetwo
<Callout>
  Gamo2 is known to have sales very rarely and for short periods of time as well (usually around black friday). It might be better to wait for then or wait till they come into the US storehouse to get one for cheaper. They announce sales and restocks over on their [Twitter @GamoTwo](https://x.com/GamoTwo)
</Callout>
Made by Gamo2 who also made the Phoneixwan for IIDX, the [Faucetwo](https://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=277) is a very common and recommend controller that a lot of players use. To see a review on it I'd recommend [Tokaku review on the Faucetwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGUSWQXGf6Y)


When going to buy the you can choose from the Vivid Wave or Exceed Gear skin. The only difference is that the Exceed Gear skin comes with the metal plate while the Vivid Wave skin gives you the option to add it or remove it.

When looking at an controller, there are a lot of options that you can choose from. Here are all the options and the differences

Button - You can either choose DJDAO or Sanwa. Sanwa are more expensive but do feel better. The difference is noticable but much more of a luxery. 

Switch - Switches make up most of the feel of the controller. There are 3 types of switches to get Honeywell, Omoron, and OBSA-LHS1F. There are two types of Omoron but they feel similar. 
- Honeywell -  These are really bad, it is recommend to not get honeywell at the minimum. 
- Omoron - These are the recommend for most players. They feel good and are sometimes even prefered over the OBSA-LHS1F. 
- OBSA-LHS1F - These are the switches that are used in the arcade. Like Sanwa these are more of a luxery. Note you have to have Sanwa buttons to use these switches. For a while these switches were known to start misfire relativly quickly, but it was assume this was just a bad batch. Generally though, people consider these switches to have a shorter lifespan.

Knob unit type - You can either choose the VM style knobs or the GAMO2 damping knob unit. The GAMO2 damping knob unit feel very good and should be good for everyone. The VM knobs are mainly luxery and not needed at all.

Metal panel - Make a small difference in feel and sound. [Here is Neardayo showing off the metal panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGnRTtvpA4). In general not needed.

Spring and Switch weight - There are a lot of options that you can choose. In general the best option is 20/100. Some people also enjoy 40/100 as the buttons rebounds a bit faster.
If you are using DJDAO, you won't be given the option to get 20g springs. In that case, 60/100 is also good but note it will be a bit heavier. Spring and switch weight is heavily preference, some people like heavier buttons while others like lighter ones.

For more information about switches, springs, buttons, and weight you can check the [parts page.](parts)


For as close to how an arcade feels as possible, it would look like this.

This is overkill for most people especially if you are just starting. At the minimum it is recommended to just upgrade from Honeywell as switches make up most of the feel and Honeywell are notoiously bad.

It is important to note that the Faucetwo is highly customizeable and it is very easy to change what switch, spring, button you are using. You can always buy the individual switches/springs/buttons and put them in your controller with little hassle.


### Yuancon
[Yuancon](https://yuancon.store/controller) are also a very popular controller choice. While they have less choices for switches and button choice, they are sometimes cheaper and can also be upgraded.

Specifically, the [Yuancon LITE](https://yuancon.store/controller/sdvxlite) can be a nice starter controller if you want to get into voltex but dont want to spend so much for a Faucetwo. 

## Other inputs
<Callout>
  These input methods will make some patterns trivial that are normally hard on an arcade size controller. Especially in the higher level charts (17+) where more one-hand, hand-trip are prevelent. 
</Callout>
There exist other options to play the game if you don't want to spend as much and are just getting into the game. It is recommend to start off with one of these inputs to see if you like the game before buying a controller.

### Keyboard
Keyboard is the recommend way to start trying the game if you are new. There are a lot of different ways to bind your setup and you might find something that you like that no one else does.

[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/579052485709266956/1046265689712885780/image.png?ex=6786821b&is=6785309b&hm=aebf91892e5cc0437eeee0a5d69c61266d03f2df93969adf7af5799bea85f7eb&) is a guide written by JiminP on getting started with keyboard and different keybind settings to try.

### Controller
It is possible to play on a controller as well. While I am not familiar with this and how it works, [Here is a video of someone clearing MixxioN MXM with a PS4 controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PFIBQr5zMU)

Lasers go on joysticks left and right and everything else on buttons. 



## Not Recommend Controllers
This is a list of not recommend controllers. Whether it's for price, quality, or both, it's recommended to maybe consider other options. 

This is mainly my opinion and what I've have seen from the community. 

### "Mini" controllers
While these controllers aren't bad and are often built well, it still has the same problems as keyboards in which it makes a lot of patterns trivial. While a cool gimmick, it is more just a glorified keyboard and not really worth the price. If you can't DIY make one for cheap, it is more recommend to just take that money and save for a full size controller.

### SDVX -Nemsys- Entry model
Made by Konami this is the "Entry" model for their own controllers. The entry model is notoriously horrid. Bad buttons, Bad switches, Bad knobs, Bad build. It is also a bit overprice. Avoid.

[Here is Neardayo showing one off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnfM9r1FwX0)

### SDVX -Nemsys- Ultimate Model rev.2
Not to be confused with the Entry model, this controller isn't actually bad. It is pretty good with players like DOLCE using it. The main problem is that if you are not in Japan, it is quite overpriced. If you don't live in Japan, generally its better to just get an Faucetwo.
