# What input should I use?
This section will cover different controllers and input types.

Controllers are expensive! If you are just starting, I'd recommend trying the game either at an arcade or with your keyboard before you go all in with a controller. Make sure you like the game first!

<Callout>
 This guide does not list all the controllers/ways to play. There are many different controllers out there. This just goes through some of the more common ones.

## Arcade-Size Controllers
These are the best controllers that you can buy. 

There are a couple options when it comes to controllers. The main choices are
either a Faucetwo or Yuancon. Gameplay wise, these controllers are essentially
the same although the Faucetwo tends to be more popular option because of it's better knobs.

### Faucetwo
<Callout>
 Gamo2 is known to have sales very rarely and for short periods of time as well (usually around Black Friday). It might be better to wait for them or wait till they come into the US storehouse to get one for cheaper. They announce sales and restocks over on their [Twitter @GamoTwo](https://x.com/GamoTwo)
</Callout>
Made by Gamo2 who also made the Phoneixwan for IIDX, the [Faucetwo](https://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=277) is a very common and recommended controller that a lot of players use. To see a review on it I'd recommend [Tokaku review on the Faucetwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGUSWQXGf6Y)


When going to buy a controller, you can choose from the Vivid Wave or Exceed Gear skin. The only difference is that the Exceed Gear skin comes with a metal plate while the Vivid Wave skin gives you the option to add it or remove it.

When looking at a controller, there are a lot of options that you can choose from. Here are all the options and the differences

- Buttons
  - DJDAO: Cheaper version of Sanwa. Feel a bit more plastic
  - Sanwa: What arcades use. More of a luxery

- Switch - Switches make up most of the feel of the controller. There are 3 types of switches to get Honeywell, Omoron, and OBSA-LHS1F. There are two types of Omoron but they feel similar. 
  - Honeywell: Cheapest option. Not recommend. Also known as Chinese switches.
  - Omoro: These are the recommend. 
  - OBSA-LHS1F: These are the switches that are used in the arcade. Like Sanwa these are more of a luxery. Note you have to have Sanwa buttons to use these switches. 

- Knob unit type:
  - VM-style Knobs: Most similar to arcade.
  - GAMO2 Damping knob unit: Cheaper option. These knobs use dampers, which you have to replace every once in a while. These Knobs feel good and are not much of a downgrade.

Metal panel:  Make a small difference in feel and sound. [Here is Neardayo showing off the metal panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGnRTtvpA4). In general not needed.

Spring and Switch weight - There are a lot of options that you can choose. Arcade is 20/100 and what is the most popular. Some people also enjoy 40/100 as the buttons rebounds a bit faster.
If you are using DJDAO, you won't be given the option to get 20g springs. In that case, 60/100 is also good but note it will be a bit heavier. Spring and switch weight are heavily preference, some people like heavier buttons while others like lighter ones.

For more information about switches, springs, buttons, and weight you can check the [parts page.](parts)


For as close to how an arcade feels as possible, it would look like this.

This is overkill for most people especially if you are just starting. At the minimum it is recommended to just upgrade from Honeywell as switches make up most of the feel and Honeywell are notoiously bad.

It is important to note that the Faucetwo is highly customizeable and it is very easy to change what switch, spring, button you are using. You can always buy the individual switches/springs/buttons and put them in your controller with little hassle.


### Yuancon
[Yuancon](https://yuancon.store/controller) is also a very popular controller choice. While they have fewer choices for switches and button choices, they are sometimes cheaper and can also be upgraded.

Specifically, the [Yuancon LITE](https://yuancon.store/controller/sdvxlite) can be a nice starter controller if you want to get into voltex but dont want to spend so much for a Faucetwo. 

## Other inputs
<Callout>
 These input methods will make some patterns trivial that are normally hard on an arcade size controller. Especially in the higher level charts (17+) where more one-hands and hand-trips are prevelent. 
</Callout>
There exist other options to play the game if you don't want to spend as much and are just getting into the game. It is recommended to start with one of these inputs to see if you like the game before buying a controller.

### Keyboard
Keyboard is the recommend way to start trying the game if you are new. There are a lot of different ways to bind your setup and you might find something that you like that no one else does.

[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/579052485709266956/1046265689712885780/image.png?ex=6786821b&is=6785309b&hm=aebf91892e5cc0437eeee0a5d69c61266d03f2df93969adf7af5799bea85f7eb&) is a guide written by JiminP on getting started with keyboard and different keybind settings to try.

### Controller
It is possible to play on a controller as well. While I am not familiar with this and how it works, [Here is a video of someone clearing MixxioN MXM with a PS4 controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PFIBQr5zMU)

Lasers go on joysticks left and right and everything else on buttons. 



## Not Recommend Controllers
This is a list of not recommend controllers. Whether it's for price, quality, or both, it's recommended to maybe consider other options. 

This is mainly my opinion and what I have seen from the community. 

### "Mini" controllers
While these controllers aren't bad and are often built well, they still have the same problems as keyboards in which it makes a lot of patterns trivial. While a cool gimmick, it is more just a glorified keyboard and not really worth the price. If you can't DIY make one for cheap, it is more recommend to just take that money and save for a full size controller.

### SDVX -Nemsys- Entry model
Made by Konami this is the "Entry" model for their controllers. The entry model is notoriously horrid. Bad buttons, Bad switches, Bad knobs, Bad build. It is also a bit overpriced. Avoid.

[Here is Neardayo showing one off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnfM9r1FwX0)

### SDVX -Nemsys- Ultimate Model rev.2
Not to be confused with the Entry model, this controller isn't bad. It is pretty good with players like DOLCE using it. The main problem is that if you are not in Japan, it is quite overpriced. If you don't live in Japan, generally its better to just get an Faucetwo.
