## Intro

This section covers controllers and other input devices.

Controllers are expensive! If you are just starting out, try the game either at an arcade or with your keyboard before you commit to a purchase. Make sure you like the game first!

<Callout>
  This guide does not cover all the types of controllers/ways to play. There are
  many different controllers out there, but these are the more common ones.
</Callout>

## Arcade-size Controllers (ASC)

The two main options when it comes to ASCs are FAUCETWO+ and YuanCon. Both have arcade-accurate layouts, offer identical gameplay experiences, and their parts are easily customizable.

### FAUCETWO+

Manufactured by GAMO2, this is the most popular and frequently recommended controller to purchase. Many reviews can be found on YouTube, with [Tokaku's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGUSWQXGf6Y) being the most popular.

They offer two versions of their controller: the Vivid Wave (VW) or Exceed Gear (EG) skin. Besides the aesthetic difference, the EG skin version includes the price of a metal plate which must be configured separately for the VW skin version.

#### Pros and Cons

##### Pros

- More pre-purchase customization options
- Arcade-accurate knobs tops
- Toolless access to internals

##### Cons

- More expensive compared to YuanCon

<Callout>
  For US players, GAMO2 occasionally restocks their [US
  storehouse](https://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=281),
  usually around Black Friday. Their controllers can be purchased for much
  cheaper as shipping cost is greatly reduced. They announce restocks on their
  [Twitter page](https://x.com/GamoTwo).
</Callout>

#### Configuration Options

- **Button and spring:**

  - **DJDAO (recommended):** Cheaper default option which can be considered a Chinese clone of Sanwa buttons
  - **Sanwa:** More premium option which are used in arcade cabinets

If you select DJDAO, choose the option with 60g springs.\
If you select Sanwa, choose the option with 20g springs.

- **Microswitch of BT/FX buttons:**

  - **Honeywell:** Cheapest option with poor durability
  - **Omron (recommended):** Most common option with good durability
  - **OBSA-LHS1F:** These switches are used in arcade cabinets. Note that you **must** select Sanwa buttons as they are not compatible with DJDAO buttons.

See the [parts page](/parts) for more detailed information about buttons, springs, and switches.

- **Knob unit type:**

  - **VM Style knob unit:** GAMO2's reproduction of the knob assembly used in Valkyrie Model arcade cabinets
  - **GAMO2 damping knob unit (recommended):** Cheaper default option but still perform well

- **Metal panel:** A metal panel that aims to improve the feel and sound of
  the controller. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGnRTtvpA4) is a showcase
  of it by Neardayo.

#### Differences between FAUCETWO and FAUCETWO+

The FAUCETWO+ is an improved version of the FAUCETWO that was introduced in November 2023. The main differences compared to the older FAUCETWO are:

- Knob assembly no longer uses consumable rubber dampeners
- Knob tension is adjustable without tools
- Only one USB cable is necessary, with a second being optional for brighter lights
- Exceed Gear skin option
- Metal plate option

### YuanCon

Manufactured by YuanCon, another popular choice for controllers. As of April 2025, they offer two SDVX controllers:

- SDVX 12 is the more expensive option with a larger case and many lights
- SDVX LITE 3 is the cheaper option with a smaller case (layout is unchanged) and fewer lights

The differences besides the cost are purely aesthetic, so the SDVX LITE 3 is more often recommended.

#### Pros and Cons

##### Pros

- Cheaper compared to FAUCETWO+

##### Cons

- Limited customization options before purchase
- Knobs tops are not arcade-accurate (completely smooth and not faceted)
- Poor USB port design commonly leads to failure (a spare is provided)
- Internal access requires tools

#### Configuration Options

Both the SDVX 12 and SDVX LITE 3 have an option for Sanwa buttons with 20g springs and OBSA-LHS1F switches. This is the configuration used in arcade cabinets.

## Other inputs

<Callout>
  These input methods will make some patterns trivial that are normally hard on
  an arcade size controller. Especially in the higher level charts (17+) where
  more one-hands and hand-trips are prevelent.
</Callout>
There exist other options to play the game if you don't want to spend as much and
are just getting into the game. It is recommended to start with one of these inputs
to see if you like the game before buying a controller.

### Keyboard

Keyboard is the recommend way to start trying the game if you are new. There are a lot of different ways to bind your setup and you might find something that you like that no one else does.

[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/579052485709266956/1046265689712885780/image.png?ex=6786821b&is=6785309b&hm=aebf91892e5cc0437eeee0a5d69c61266d03f2df93969adf7af5799bea85f7eb&) is a guide written by JiminP on getting started with keyboard and different keybind settings to try.

## Not Recommended Controllers

These controllers are not recommended due to price, quality, etc.

### Mini Controllers

While these controllers aren't bad and are often built well, they still have the
same problems as keyboards in which it makes a lot of patterns trivial. While a
cool gimmick, it is more just a glorified keyboard and not really worth the
price. If you can't DIY make one for cheap, it is recommend to just take
that money and save for a full size controller.

### SDVX -Nemsys- Entry Model

Made by Konami this is the "Entry" model for their controllers. The entry model is notoriously bad. Bad buttons, Bad switches, Bad knobs, Bad build. It is also a bit overpriced. Avoid.

[Here is Neardayo showing one off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnfM9r1FwX0)

### SDVX -Nemsys- Ultimate Model rev.2

Not to be confused with the Entry model, this controller isn't bad. It is pretty good with players like DOLCE using it. The main problem is that if you are not in Japan, it is quite overpriced. If you don't live in Japan, generally its better to just get an Faucetwo.
