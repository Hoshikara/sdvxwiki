## Intro
This section will cover different controllers and input types.

Controllers are expensive! If you are just starting, It is recommended to try the game either at an arcade or with your keyboard first before you go all in with a controller. Make sure you like the game first!

<Callout>
 This guide does not list all the controllers/ways to play. There are many different controllers out there. This just goes through some of the more common ones.

## Arcade-Size Controllers
There are a couple options when it comes to AC controllers. The main choices are
either a Faucetwo or Yuancon. Gameplay wise, these controllers are essentially
the same. 

The Faucetwo tends to be more popular option because of its better knobs and more customization options. 

YuanCon, specifically the YuanCon LITE, can be much cheaper than a Faucetwo.

### Faucetwo
<Callout>
 Gamo2 is known to have sales very rarely and for short periods of time as well (usually around Black Friday). It might be better to wait for them or wait till they come into the US storehouse to get one for cheaper. They announce sales and restocks over on their [Twitter @GamoTwo](https://x.com/GamoTwo)
</Callout>
<Callout>
 If you buy second-hand, you might come across a normal Faucetwo without
 the plus. These are discontinued. The main difference is the knob unit which is
 described below. If you can, it is recommended that you get the Faucetwo+.
</Callout>
Made by Gamo2 who also made the Phoneixwan for IIDX, the [Faucetwo](https://www.gamo2.com/en/index.php?dispatch=categories.view&category_id=277) is a very common and recommended controller that a lot of players use. To see a review on it, [here is Tokaku review on the Faucetwo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGUSWQXGf6Y)

When going to buy a controller, you can choose from the Vivid Wave or Exceed Gear skin. The only difference is that the Exceed Gear skin comes with a metal plate while the Vivid Wave skin gives you the option to add it or remove it.

When looking at a controller, there are a lot of options that you can choose from. Here are all the options and the differences

- **Buttons:**
  - **DJDAO:** Cheaper buttons. Feel a bit more plastic, and can have friction issues
  - **Sanwa:** What arcades use. More of a luxury

- **Switch:** 
  - **Honeywell:** Cheapest option. Also known as Chinese switches. NOT RECOMMENDED.
  - **Omron:** Middle ground between Honeywell and OBSA. These are recommended. 
  - **OBSA-LHS1F:** These are the switches that are used in the arcade. Like Sanwa these are more of a luxury. Note you have to have Sanwa buttons to use these switches. 

- **Knob unit type:**
  - **VM-style Knobs:** Most similar to arcade.
  - **GAMO2 Damping knob unit:** Cheaper option. You can adjust how tight or loose they are. These Knobs feel good and are not much of a downgrade.

**Metal panel:** Makes a small difference in feel and sound. [Here is Neardayo showing off the metal panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGnRTtvpA4). In general not needed.

**Switch and spring weight:** There are a lot of options that you can choose.
Arcade spec is 100/20 (100g switch, 20g spring) and is the most popular. Some people also enjoy 100/40 as
the buttons rebound a bit faster. If you are using DJDAO, you won't be given
the option to get 20g springs; in that case, 100/60 is also good, but note it
will be a bit heavier. Switch and spring weight are down to personal preference, some
people like heavier buttons while others like lighter ones.

There also exists the normal Faucetwo without the plus that has a different knob
unit. These use physical dampers that you have to replace every once in a while.
These feel about the same as the GAMO2 Damping knob unit.

The general consensus is that switches make up most of the feeling for controllers. 

For more information about switches, springs, buttons, and weight you can check the [parts page.](parts)


For as close to how an arcade feels as possible, it would look like this.

</div>

This is overkill for most people, especially if you are just starting out. At the
minimum, it is recommended to just upgrade from Honeywell, as switches make up
most of the feel and Honeywells are notoriously bad.

It is important to note that the Faucetwo is highly customizeable and it is very
easy to change what switch, spring, button you are using. You can always buy the
individual switches/springs/buttons and put them in your controller with little
hassle.


### Yuancon
[Yuancon](https://yuancon.store/controller) is also a very popular controller choice. While they have fewer choices for switches and button choices, they are sometimes cheaper and can also be upgraded.

Specifically, the [Yuancon LITE](https://yuancon.store/controller/sdvxlite) can be a nice starter controller if you want to get into SDVX but dont want to spend so much for a Faucetwo. 

## Other inputs
<Callout>
 These input methods will make some patterns trivial that are normally hard on an arcade size controller. Especially in the higher level charts (17+) where more one-hands and hand-trips are prevelent. 
</Callout>
There exist other options to play the game if you don't want to spend as much and are just getting into the game. It is recommended to start with one of these inputs to see if you like the game before buying a controller.

### Keyboard
Keyboard is the recommended way to try out the game if you are new. There are a lot of different ways to bind your setup and you might find something that you like that no one else does.

[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/579052485709266956/1046265689712885780/image.png?ex=6786821b&is=6785309b&hm=aebf91892e5cc0437eeee0a5d69c61266d03f2df93969adf7af5799bea85f7eb&) is a guide written by JiminP on getting started with keyboard and different keybind settings to try.


## Not Recommended Controllers
This is a list of controllers that are not recommended. Whether it's for price, quality, or both, it's advised to maybe consider other options. 

### "Mini" controllers
While these controllers aren't bad and are often built well, they still have the
same problems as keyboards in that it makes a lot of patterns trivial. While a
cool gimmick, it is more just a glorified keyboard and not really worth the
price. If you can't DIY make one for cheap, it is recommend to just take
that money and save for a full size controller.

### SDVX -Nemsys- Entry model
Made by Konami, this is the "Entry" model for their controllers. The entry model is notoriously bad. Bad buttons, Bad switches, Bad knobs, Bad build. It is also a bit overpriced. Avoid.

[Here is Neardayo showing one off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnfM9r1FwX0)

### SDVX -Nemsys- Ultimate Model rev.2
Not to be confused with the Entry model, this controller isn't bad. It is pretty good with players like DOLCE using it. The main problem is that if you are not in Japan, it is quite overpriced. If you don't live in Japan, generally it is better to just get a Faucetwo.
