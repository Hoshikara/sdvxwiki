## Parts
<Callout>
  This guide assumes you are talking about an arcade-size controller that allows customization.

### Buttons
You will mostly see two different types of buttons: DJDAO and Sanwa. Sanwa is
the more expensive option and is of higher quality. DJDAO feels a bit more
cheap/plastic compared to Sanwa. In-game, this doesn't matter too much,
especially if you are playing lower levels.

Sound Voltex cabinets typically use Sanwa buttons. If you would like to know how they feel that is a good example. 

Buttons are usually one purchase for life. They don't break easily and are good for long amounts of time compared to switches. 

An important thing to know is that OBSA-LHS1F switches only work with Sanwas. 

### Switches
There are 3 different types of switches. Honeywell, Omoron, and OBSA-LHS1F. Switches are arguably the most important part of the feel of your controller.

- **Honeywell:** Feels the worst. Usually the cheapest. 
- **Omron:** Generally the recommended option. These feel good and usually have a good life span. They come in a lot of different weights and types.
- **OBSA-LHS1F:** What Valkyrie cabinets use. Usually considered an upgrade from Omron. They only come in one weight (100g) and sometimes are known to go bad quicker than Omrons. They also only work with Sanwa buttons.

### Springs and weight 
Springs come in different weights and add to the rebound of the buttons. The
heavier the spring, the faster it rebounds but the more pressure it takes to
press. Depending on where you are, arcades might run a different setup. The most
common for Valkyrie cabs is 100/20 (100g switches, 20g springs). Korea cabs sometimes run 50/60.

There are a lot of different options when it comes to weight. Here is a general tier list for spring switch combos found in the [Voltex Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/sdvx).

There are a lot of different opinions and it all mostly comes down to preference. Some people like heavy springs so it rebounds faster while others like lighter ones for stamina.
