### Buttons
You will mostly see two different types of buttons: DJDAO and Sanwa. Sanwa is the more expensive option and is of higher quality. DJDAO feels a bit more cheap/plastic compared to Sanwa. In-game, this doesn't matter too much, especially if you are playing lower levels.

Sound Voltex cabinets use Sanwa buttons. If you would like to know how they feel that is a good example. 

Buttons and Sanwa especially are usually one purchase for life. They don't break easily and are good for long amounts of time compared to switches. 

An important thing to know is that OBSA-LHS1F switches only work with Sanwas. 

### Switches
There are 3 different types of switches. Honeywell, Omoron, and OBSA-LHS1F. Switches are arguably the most important part of the feel of your controller.

- Honeywell is the worst option. These are notoriously horrible. It is recommended to stay away as the Omoron upgrade is not too much more expensive. 
- Omoron is generally the recommended option. These feel good and usually have a good life span. They come in a lot of different weights and types. But besides the weight, most of them feel pretty similar. 
- OBSA-LHS1F is what Valkiery cabinets use. These are the best switches you can buy on the market. They only come in one weight 100g and are known to go bad quicker than Omorons. They also only work with Sanwa buttons.

### Springs and weight 
Springs come in different weights and add to the rebound of the buttons. The heavier the spring, the faster it rebounds but the more pressure it takes to press. Depending on where you are, arcades might run a different setup. The most common for valkiery cabs is 20g springs and 100g buttons. Korea cabs run 50g switch 60g buttons. 

There are a lot of different options when it comes to weight. Here is a general tier list for spring switch combos found in the [Voltex Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/sdvx).

There are a lot of different opinions and it all mostly comes down to preference. Some people like heavy springs so it rebounds faster while others like lighter ones for stamina.
