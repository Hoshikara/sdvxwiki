## Parts
<Callout>
  This guide assumes you are talking about an Arcade-size Controller (ASC) that allows customization.

### Buttons
There are two types of buttons: DJDAO and Sanwa. All offical Sound Voltex cabinets use Sanwa buttons. 

Buttons are a one purchase for life. They don't break easily and usually never need to be replaced.


#### DJDAO
- Cheaper 
- More plastic feeling
- Can't use OBSA switch

#### Sanwa
- Expensive [(Around 100$ on BSE)](https://bluespringexpress.net/en-us/collections/all/products/sdvx-sanwa-set)
- Same buttons as arcade
- Can use OBSA Switches.


### Switches
Switches make up most of the feel of your controller.

There are 3 different types of switches. Honeywell, Omoron, and OBSA-LHS1F. 

#### Honeywell
- Cheapest
- Bad quality, Bad durability
- Often very light, making it hard to play

#### OBSA-LHS1F

### Springs and weight 
Springs are what pushes the button back up after it's pressed down. They come in different weights.

A heavier spring means the faster the rebound of the button, but the more force
it takes to push down. This can mean that if you get springs too heavy, you
might notice yourself being more tired than using a lighter spring.

Arcades might use a different Spring/Switch weight. Valkyrie Cabs in Japan and
USA commonly use 20g Spring with 100g Switches. Korea cabs commonly use 50g
Springs with 60g Switches.

There are a lot of different options when it comes to weight. Here is a general tier list for Spring/Switch combos found in the [Voltex Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/sdvx).
