# Konasute コナステ

Konasute is an offical PC port of SDVX made by Konami. This is considered the best way to play at home as it uses the same engine as the arcade. While there is content that is exclusively arcade only (that mainly being newer content), 
this port has a lot of the same features as arcade, 120hz, infinity quick retries, quick crash out, and can even see your scores from arcade.
