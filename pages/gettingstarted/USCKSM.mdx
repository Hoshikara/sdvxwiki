# USC and KSM
There are two simulators you can use for Sound Voltex. While simulators are not as accurute, they can be used to play custom charts and also converts of offical charts. 

You can either play Untitled Sound Voltex Clone (USC) or K-Shoot Mania (KSM). KSM is much older and it's age shows. USC is more new and has a lot of features but considered to have slightly worse lasers. I'd recommned using USC to get started as it is easier to use and comes with a lot more features.

## USC Set-up
<Callout>
  This will only go through setting up USC. There is a lot of stuff you can do with it and this guide won't go through all the stuff that is in it.
</Callout>
To start, head to [the USC Github](https://github.com/Drewol/unnamed-sdvx-clone/releases/) and download the latest version.

Extract this file to a folder on your computer and run usc-game.exe one time. This will launch the game and create all the files we need. You can now close the game.

### Skins
While the default skin is fine, you will most likely want other skins. Head to [this website](https://oniichan.wtf/help/skins.html) and choose a skin to your liking. Most likely you will want to either use
- Nightfall. Has S-Crits and shows a lot of information. If you don't know what to get, get this one.
- LiqidWave. Makes your game as look similar to Sound Voltex Vivid Wave as possible. If you like Vivid Wave or just the Sound Voltex look get this one.
- Heavenly Express. Basically LiquidWave, but for Sound Voltex Heavenly Haven. 

The rest of the skins are mostly out-of-date or not used. 

After you download the one you want, put the folder into the skins folder. For example, /USC/skins is where I would put my skins. Make sure they are extracted.

### Options
Press the Settings button on the main screen to take you to the settings. While most of the stuff I won't go over, some important things to change are 
- Input. Set up your controls here. If you are using a controller, set it to gamepad mode (one without a mouse) and use controller for both input mode. Also recommended to calibrate your laser sensitivity. 
- Game. Set Speed mod type to MMod. This is how it is SDVX. You can set your speed here if you want, or change it in game.
- Skin. Select your skin. Depending on the skin it might have some aditional setting for you to configure. 

### Charts
To find custom made charts, you can head to [ksm.dev](https://ksm.dev/) and find most custom charts made by people. While they definitly vary in quality, and a lot of them are higher level charts, it can be a good way of finding charts for songs you like.

You can also play converts. Older charts can be found on [here](https://oniichan.wtf/help/songs.html) and for recent charts you can find them in the [Sound Voltex discord](https://discord.com/invite/sdvx).

After downloading a chart, place the folder in the songs folder. For example, /USC/songs is where I would put my skins. Make sure they are extracted.
