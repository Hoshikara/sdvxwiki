# Setting up Konasute
<Callout>
  There is a really good guide [here](https://voltexes.com/setting-up-sound-voltex-konasute-exceed-gear/) that talks about setting up Konasute. While some small stuff has changed, this takes a lot of information from there.

  For setting up e-amusement, there is a good website [here](https://3icecream.com/tutorial/check-eamuse) that helps you set it up. While its for DDR most stuff still applies here.

This section will be covering setting up Konasute. Konasute is an offical PC port of SDVX made by Konami. This is considered the best way to play at home as it uses the same engine as the arcade. While there is content that is exclusively arcade only (that mainly being newer content), 
this port has a lot of the same features as arcade, 120hz, infinity quick retries, quick crash out, and can even see your scores from arcade. 

The main disadvatage with Konasute is that it cost money with it being a monthly subscription of 1,628 yen. There are also song packs that can be pretty expensive espcically if there isn't a sale going on. Another thing is that downtime happens every day. During that time you will not be able to launch the game.

## Creating a Konami account
The first thing is setting up your Koanmi acccount. This account will let you customize your games, buy Konasute and song packs, and store all your data among other things. 

First, you want to head to the [My Konami](https://my.konami.net/en_US) website and click register. Fill out all your information and make sure to select Japan for your region otherwise you will be locked out of purchasing Konasute. 
You can also change your region [here](https://my1.konami.net/ja/personal-info) if you accidently didn't select Japan.

## Downloading Konasute
Head to the [Konasute website](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/eacsdvx/vi/index.html) and click install in the top right. If you are not login, you won't see this button and instead it will be replaced by a login button.
Click the "同意してインストーラーをダウンロード" to download the launcher.

This will start the download for the launcher. Upon opening the launcher, it will all be in japanese. To go through it
- Click 次へ. (Next)
- Accept the terms with the checkbox and click 次へ. (Next)
- Change the game data install or leave it as default and click 次へ. (Next)
- Click インストール. (Install)
- Click 終了. (Finish) 

You can now open the game. If you can't find it, it installed default at C:/Games/SOUND VOLTEX EXCEED GEAR. From there you can head to /game/modules/sv6c.exe. You can also head to [this site](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/konasteapp/API/login/login.html?game_id=sdvx).

The launcher will take you to a website in which you will have to login. This acts as an launcher for the game. You have to go through this website to start up Konasute. If you want to bookmark this website as a way to launch the game you can. Pressing "ゲーム起動" will start the game.

Konasute and Konami services are always down between 5AM to 7AM JST every day. You will be unable to launch the game or access the website during these times. Read more [here](/downtime)

If you just recently open the website then closed it, it might think you are opening it twice and show you a different screen. Press "起動処理を続ける" to continue.

This will open the launcher. You will get a notification that you need to download the game. Click OK and you will go to another menu in which you press "UPDATE" to start downloading the game. If this doesn't pop-up, you can also press the button in the top right called "ファイル確認" to get to the menu.

You will now install Konasute which is known to take some time. Konami limits how fast you are able to download. 

When it is done another menu will open showing you its done. If you check the box in the middle and press close, the launcher will reopen. You can now start the game with "GAME START" but you might want to configure some options first.

## Options
Pressing the "SETTING" button will open the options for the game. All of it is in japanese. Here is my rough translation of everything.

![settings1](/konasute/settings1.png)
- Windows options. From top to bottom, Fullscreen, Fit window (borderless window), window. Most likely keep Fullscreen "フルスクリーン"
- Monitor. Self explanatory
- Game rotation. Choose which way you want the game rotated. If you want to play portrait and you set your montior portrait in windows settings, keep as it on top left. Otherwise select bottom right.
- Resolution. Self explanatory
- Frame rate. Unless you want to play 60, choose the other option for 120hz.

If you are using a Faucetwo or Yuancon, you should not touch this. It should work by default. If it doesn't press the "Reset to default" button.
