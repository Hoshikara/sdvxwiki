# Arcade

## Finding a SDVX Cabinet
By far the cheapest but hardest way to play depending on where you live is at the arcade. Currently, there is only one official arcade where you can play SDVX on the official servers in America, being Round1. If you live by one you can go and get an e-amusement pass and officially play SDVX. Otherwise, there are also offline cabs or cabs that run on unofficial servers that you can find. If you go to [zenius](https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/arcades.php), select SOUND VOLTEX, and look at your area, you can find what cab is the closest to you.

Your search should look like something like this. I would first check if there is a Valkyrie model nearby, then select SOUND VOLTEX EXCEED GEAR.

## Playing on the arcade for the first time
### Get an eamusement card
E-Amusement cards are used to save your profile and can be used for other games outside of SDVX as well.
If you are at an Round1 or some arcades, you can pick up a e-amusement card at the front desk.

They look something like this and will cost about $5-$10. Try to get one with the Amusement IC logo like this one in the bottom left. Most cards have this logo as the older ones have been mostly phased out.

Any card with this logo on it will work. For example Aime, BANAPASS and NESiCA. 

## Creating an account
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
If you have played Konasute it is **HIGHLY** recommoned to transfer your Konasute data to that card before creating data on the card. This is because if the card has data, you will be unable combine your Konasute data with your arcade data on that card. You can find more information about how to link in the [Konasute コナスデ](/konasute) section

Once you have your e-amusement card, head over to the SDVX arcade and scan your card on pad.

Simply put your card near the pad and it should recognize it and prompt you to create a profile.

## Creating a profile and playing your first credit
<Callout>
  A lot of information here is coming from [this guide](https://voltexes.com/arcade-quick-start-guide-eg/). If you are lost, I'd recommoned checking out their guide.

After you scan your card, you will have to create your profile.

![start1](/arcade/start1.jpg)

You will be asked to either transfer data or create new data. Simply create new data since you don't have data to transfer.

![start2](/arcade/start2.jpg)

You will then create a PIN. This PIN will be used on all other bemani games that you play.

![start3](/arcade/start3.jpg)

You will then create your name. Use the knobs to scroll and press start to select a character. Once you have your name you want, just scroll to the end button and finish making your profile.

After you create your profile, there will be a lot of options available. For just getting started select normal then standard start. If standard isn't available, select light start. Standard is better as it lets you use S-CRIT, ARS, and no level restrictions among other things. For more information on what all those things are you can find out (finish).

One you press normal and select which one you have, you will be in your room. Here you can change your crew, which is the person on the background. If you are playing on an American cab, there will be nobody on the background as American cabs are censored. You can still select a character though. You can also change your appeal card. Finally you can select start and begin your credit.
